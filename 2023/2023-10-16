### Lab organization

- see what do to with the Sharepoint / many hardrives / dropbox / one drive
- I post everything on github, prefer another platform?
- Password for the dropbox
- I don't know what type of access we have with the share point, and the size of the server?
- Need other hardrives? To do backups of the final projects? At least two, to safely store two copies of the finished projects. 
- Translation to do once the protocol is in its final version
- Best structure from Julien's document
