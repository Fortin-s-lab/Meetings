### Lab organization

- see what do to with the Sharepoint / many hardrives / dropbox / one drive
- I post everything on github, prefer another platform?
- Password for the dropbox
- I don't know what type of access we have with the share point, and the size of the server?
- SharePoint with 1 To.
- Need other hardrives? To do backups of the final projects? At least two, to safely store two copies of the finished projects. 
- Translation to do once the protocol is in its final version
- Best structure from Julien's document


Store raw datasets --> https://osf.io/ OR access.

>  OSF limits the capacity of private projects and components utilizing OSF Storage to 5 GB and public projects and components to 50 GB and advises users to integrate add-ons to their projects for storage management wherever possible. For more information please see our help guides on project storage below: 

    Storage Caps
    OSF will limit the capacity of private projects and components utilizing OSF Storage to 5 GB and public projects and components to 50 GB, and advises users to integrate add-ons to their projects for storage management wherever possible. 

For our projects (ie the one of the people still in the lab):
- One folder / person
- Subfolder should be organised as chapters
- Each figure should have a metadata file attached, explaining how this figure was produced (software, script's name and location), what data were used to produce it (and the path to get them)
- Script: each script should have a small paragraph at the beginning, explaining the goal of the script, the analysis it runs, and the outputs it makes (with maybe the path to get there).
- GIS files: each GIS file should have a metadata file attached explaining the variables and stuff
- Every dataset should have a metadata file attached ("name_of_the_file_metadata") explaining the variables it uses and the units, the abbreviations if needed

## Backups
One save before leaving the lab with everything as tidy as possible
Several saves are recommanded: one per month, max one per session --> does everyone has a hardrive to do that?

Loads of datasets therre and scripts, impressive

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Everyone should go and clean the data for their own animals
- Francis cleaned the data from the old students, put on the "Backup" hardrive
- 2 hardrives for the back
- one hard drive / animals video that should not be plugged all the time
